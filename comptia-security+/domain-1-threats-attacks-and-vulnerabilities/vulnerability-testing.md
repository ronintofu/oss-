# Vulnerability Testing

### **Vulnerability Scanning**

* Vulnerability - A flaw in a system that can leave it open to attack. A vulnerability may also refer to any type of weakness in a computer system itself, in a set of procedures, or in anything that leaves information security exposed to a threat.
* Vulnerability Scanning - An inspection of the potential points of exploit on a computer or network to identify security holes. A vulnerability scan detects and classifies system weaknesses in computers, networks, and communications equipment and predicts the effectiveness of countermeasures.

### **Assessment**

* Goal is to identify:
  * System, network, or application weaknesses.
  * Unpatched or not-updated systems or applications.
  * Common misconfigurations.
  * A lack of security controls.

### **Assessment Process**

* Passively test security controls.
  * Does not exploit a vulnerability.
* Identify vulnerability, system flaw, or unpatched code.
* Identify lack of security controls.
* Identify common misconfigurations by reviewing system settings, policies, or rule sets.

### **Assessment Types**

* Intrusive vs Non-Intrusive - See passive vs Active Reconnaissance.
  * Intrusive: Directly engaging on the target system to identify weaknesses that could be used to launch an attack.
  * Non-intrusive: Gain vulnerability information about targeted computers and networks without actively engaging with the systems.
    * Example: Qualys SSL Labs \(https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/\)
* Credentialed vs Non-Credentialed - Whether or not authentication credentials \(user IDs & passwords\) are used in scanning. Credentialed has lesser risks and may provide more information, but isn't as realistic.
* False Positive - Occurs when a scan mistakenly identifies a vulnerability when it is not.
