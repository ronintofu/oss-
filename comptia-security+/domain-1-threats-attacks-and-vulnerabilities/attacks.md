# Attacks

### **Christmas Tree Attack**  \[[https://youtu.be/bVrxL2AL4yQ](https://youtu.be/bVrxL2AL4yQ)\] \[[https://medium.com/cryptogennepal/did-you-know-about-the-xmas-attack-c6daae776a0e](https://medium.com/cryptogennepal/did-you-know-about-the-xmas-attack-c6daae776a0e)\] \[[https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/303.html](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/303.html)\]

* An attack designed to send a specifically crafted TCP packet to a device on the network. 
* This crafting of the packet is one that turns on a bunch of flags. 
  * There is space set up in the packet header, called flags. 
  * All these flags are turned on or off depending on what the packet is doing.
* In an Xmas tree attack, the following flags are turned on:
  * Urgent
  * Push
  * Fin
* Used as a reconnaissance technique to grab information about various operating system.
* It looks for open ports.

### **Initialization Vector Attacks**  \[[https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-401/wireless-iv-attacks/](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-401/wireless-iv-attacks/)\]

* An attack on wireless networks. 
* It modifies the IV of an encrypted wireless packet during transmission. 
* Once an attacker learns the plaintext of one packet, they can compute the RC4 key stream generated by the IV used.
* This key stream can be used to decrypt all other packets that use the same IV. 
* Since there is only a small set of possible initialization vectors, the attacker can eventually build a decryption table to decrypt every packet sent over that wireless connection. 

### **Data Exfiltration** 

* the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or device. 

### **Cross-Site Request Forgery \(XSRF/CSRF\) - AKA** [**{Session Riding}**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)\*\*\*\*

* This application issue involves unauthorized commands coming from a trusted user to a user or website. 
* Generally involves social networking. 

### **Data Diddling** - ****[{Source}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_diddling)

* An attack that changes data. 
* Authorized users usually perpetuate this attack for financial gain. 

### **Password Attacks**

* Sniffing
* Social Engineering
* _Dictionary Attack_ 
  * Focuses on cracking the password. 
  * Uses password cracking tools like [{hashcat}](https://hashcat.net/wiki/), [{cain & abel}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel_%28software%29), [{john the ripper}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Ripper), etc.
  * Employs the use of a dictionary of words as the password, such as [{rockyou} ](https://www.cyberpratibha.com/blog/how-do-i-use-rockyou-wordlist-txt-in-kali-linux/)or [{crackstation}](https://crackstation.net/crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm), to repeatedly attempt to access a system using a valid user account. 
  * To protect against dictionary attacks, a password complexity policy should be enforced that requires uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols. 
* _Brute Force_
  * Also known as _exhaustive attacks._
  * Usually cycle through a more substantial number of possibilities that can include characters, numbers, and symbols. 
  * An account length policy that requires a longer password would affect the time a manual brute force attack would take. 
* Capturing
  * Keylogger, protocol analyzer.
  * Man-in-the-middle and replay attacks.
* Resetting
  * Attacker gains physical access to a computer and resets the password.
* Online Guessing
  * Not really practical.
* Steps for using a rainbow table
  * Creating the table.
    * Chain of plaintext passwords.
    * Encrypt initial password.
    * Feed into a function that produces different plaintext passwords.
    * Repeat for a set number of rounds.
  * Using the table to crack a password.
    * Run encrypted password through same procedure used to create initial table.
    * Results in initial chain password.
  * Using the table to crack a password.
    * Repeat, starting with this initial password until original encryption is found.
    * Password used at last iteration is the cracked password.
  * Rainbow table advantages over other attack methods.
    * Can be used repeatedly.
    * Faster than dictionary attacks.
    * Less machine memory needed.

### **Debugging Hooks** aka **Maintenance Hooks** [{source}](https://itlaw.wikia.org/wiki/Maintenance_hook)

* Software code that is intentionally embedded in the software during its development process to allow the developer to bypass the regular access and authentication mechanisms. 
* These hooks can pose a threat to the security of the software and can be exploited if any maintenance hook is not removed before the software goes into production. 

### **Pseudo-Flaw** [{source}](https://itlaw.wikia.org/wiki/Pseudo-flaw) 

*  A vulnerability code embedded intentionally in the software to trap intruders.

### **Birthday Attack**

* Named after the mathematical probability that two people in the same network have the same birthday. 
* Can be used in communication abuse between two or more parties.
* It depends on a fixed degree of permutations \(pigeonholes\) and the higher likelihood of collisions found between random attack attempts.

### **Phreakers** 

*  ****Attack VoIP and PBX equipment used for telephone lines.
