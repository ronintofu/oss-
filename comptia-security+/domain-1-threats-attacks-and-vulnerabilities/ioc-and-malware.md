# IoC & Malware

**Types of Malware**

* Viruses
* Crypto-malware
* Ransomware
* Worm
* Trojan
* Rootkit
* Keylogger
* Adware
* Spyware
* Bots
* RAT
* Logic Bomb
* Backdoor

**Malware Attacks**

* Delivery - How it gets to the target.
* Propagation - How malware spreads.
* Payload - What malware does once it's delivered. 
* Indicators of Compromise \(IoC\) - An artifact observed on a network or in an operating system that, with high confidence, indicates a computer intrusion. 

**Viruses**

* Definition: A program intended to damage a computer system.
* Types:
  * **Armored Virus**: A virus that is protected in a way that makes disassembling it difficult. The difficulty makes it "armored" against antivirus programs that have trouble getting to and understanding its code.
  * **Companion Virus**: A virus that creates a new program that runs in the place of an expected program of the same name.
  * **Macro Virus**: A software exploitation virus that works by using the macro feature included in many applications such as Microsoft Office.
  * **Multipartite Virus**: A virus that attacks a system in more than one way.
  * **Multipart Virus**: Can infect both executable files and boot sectors of a hard disk drives. 
    * Resides in the memory and then infects boot sectors and executable files of the system. 
  * **Phage Virus**: A virus that modifies and alters other programs and databases.
  * **Polymorphic Virus**: A virus that changes form or mutates in order to avoid detection.
  * **Retrovirus**: A virus that attacks or bypasses the antivirus software installed on a client.
  * **Stealth Virus**: A virus that attempts to avoid detection by antivirus software and from the operating system by remaining in memory.

**Crypto-Malware & Ransomware**

* Malware that uses cryptography as part of the attack.
* Prevents users from accessing their system or personal files through encryption and demands ransom payment in order to regain access.
* Ransomware authors order that payment be sent via cryptocurrency, online payment systems, or credit card.
* Examples: CryptoLocker, WannaCry, Locky, zCrypt, NotPetya.

**Rootkit**

* A clandestine computer program designed to provide continued privileged access to a computer while actively hiding its presence.
* Software program that has the ability to obtain admin or root-level access and hid from the operating system.
* Examples: NTRootkit, Zeus, Stuxnet, Knark, Adore.

**Trojan Horse**

* A harmful piece of software that looks legit or is included with legit apps.
* Any apps that masquerades as one thing in order to get past scrutiny and then does something malicious.
  * One of the major differences between trojans and viruses is that trojans tend not to replicate themselves.
* Examples: BackOrifice, Stuxnet, Zeus

**Worms**

* Use the network to replicate copies of themselves to systems or devices automatically and without user intervention.
* To spread, worms either exploit a vulnerability on the target system or use social engineering to trick users into executing.
* A worm takes advantage of the file-transport or information-transport features on the system, allowing it to travel unaided.
* Examples: ILoveYou, MyDoom, StormWorm, Anna Kournikova, Slammer

**Logic or Time Bomb**

* Any code that is hidden within an application and causes something unexpected to happen based on some criteria being met.
* For example:
  * A programmer could create a program that always makes sure her name appears on the payroll roster; if it doesn't, then key files begin to be erased.
  * Backdoor is created during certain times.

**Keylogger**

* Software programs or hardware devices that track the activities from input devices.
  * Keys pressed of a keyboard.
  * Mouse clicks.
  * Screen recorders or scrapers.
* Keyloggers are a form of spyware where users are unaware their actions are being tracked.
* Keylogger software typically stores your keystrokes in a small file, which is either accessed later or automatically emailed to the person monitoring your actions.

**Bots / Botnets**

* **Bot**: An automated software program \(network robot\) that collects info on the web. In its malicious form, a bot is compromised computer being controlled remotely.
* Bots are also known as "zombie computers" due to their ability to operate under remote direction without their owners' knowledge.
* **Botnet**: A network of compromised computers under the control of a malicious actor.
* The attackers that control botnets are referred to as "bot herders" or "bot masters".

**Backdoor**

* An undocumented way of accessing a system, bypassing the normal authentication mechanisms.
* An opening left in a program appp \(usually by the developer\) that allows additional access to systems or data. These should be closed when the system is moved to production.

**RATs \(Remove Access Trojans or Remote Administration Tools\)**

* Software that remotely gives a person full control of a tech device.
* Programs that provide the capability to allow covert surveillance or the ability to gain unauthorized access to a victim PC.
* Provide the capability for an attacker to gain unauthorized remote access to the victim machine via specifially configured communication protocols or backdoors created upon infection.
  * Often mimic similar behaviors of keylogger apps by allowing the automated collection of input data.
* Examples: SubSeven, BackOrifice, ProRat, Turkojan, and Poison-Ivy.

**Spyware / Adware**

* Applications that covertly monitors online behavior without the user's knowledge or permission.
* Collected data is relayed to outside parties, often for use in advertising.
* Otherwise, does not harm the infected computer, user or data.
* There is a line between illegal spyware and legitimate data collection.

**Advanced Persistent Threat \(APT\)**

* A set of stealthy and continuous computer hacking processes, often orchestrated by a person or persons targeting a specific entity.
* Usually targets either private organizations, states, or both for business or political motives.
* APT processes require a high degree of covertness over a long period of time.
  * The "advanced" process signifies sophiscated techniques using malware to exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
  * The "persistent" process suggests that an external command and control \(CnC or C&C\) system is continuously monitoring and extracting data from a specific target.
  * The "threat" process indicates human involvement in orchestrating the attack.
