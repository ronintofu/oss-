# Frameworks

**Types of Frameworks**

* Regulatory vs Non-Regulatory
* National vs International
* Industry-Specific Frameworks

**Industry Standard Frameworks**

* International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\)
* National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\)
* Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \(PCI-DSS\)
* North American Electric Reliability Corporation \(NERC\)
* Center for Internet Security \(CIS\)
* Open Web Application Security Project \(OWASP\)

**ISO/IEC 27002: 2013**

* Gives guidelines for organizational information security standards and information security management practices including the selection, implementation, and management of controls taking into consideration the organization's information security risk environment\(s\).
* It is designed to be used by organizations that intend to:
  * Select controls within the process of implementing an Information Security Management System based on ISO/IEC 27001.
  * Implement commonly accepted information controls.
  * Develop their own information security management guidelines.

**ISO/IEC 27002: 2013 - Topics**

* Information Security Policies
* Organization of Information Security
* Human Resource Security
* Asset Management
* Access Control
* Cryptography
* Physical and Environmental Security
* Operation Security: Procedures and Responsibilities
* Communication Security
* System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance
* Supplier Relationships
* Incident Management
* Business Continuity Management

**ISO/IEC 27017: 2015**

* Gives guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services by providing:
  * Additional implementation guidance for relevant controls specified in the ISO/IEC 27002.
  * Additional controls with implementation guidance that specifically relate to cloud services.
* This recommendation provides controls and implementation guidance for both cloud service providers and cloud service customers.

**National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\)**

* U.S. National Standards
* The Computer Security Resource Center \(CSRC\) provides NIST's cybersecurity and information security related projects, publications, news, and events.
* The NIST Cybersecurity Framework \(NIST CSF\) is a group of related standards that are designed to provide guidance on cybersecurity.
* Each standard is published as a NIST SP \(Special Publication\).

**NIST Special Publications 800 Series \(SP800\)**

* SP 800-30 - Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
* SP 800-35 - Guide to Information Technology Security Services
* SP 800-53 - Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
* SP 800-53A - Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans

**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \(PCI-DSS\)**

* Used by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover to create common security controls for the protection of Card Holder Data \(CHD\).
* Any organization processing credit cards must be compliant.
* Levels of compliance differ.
* PCI-DSS control objectives:
  * Build and maintain a secure network.
  * Protect cardholder data.
  * Maintain a vulnerability management program.
  * Regularly monitor and test networks.
  * Maintain a vulnerability management program.

**Benchmarks / Security Configuration Guides**

* IASE - Information Assurance Support Environment
* DoD Security Technical Implementation Guides \(STIGs\)
  * Contain technical guidance to lock down information systems and software that might otherwise be vulnerable to malicious attacks.
* Center for Internet Security Benchmarks
  * CIS Benchmarks are best practices for the secure configuration of a target system. Available for more than 150 technologies, CIS Benchmarks are developed through a unique consensus-based process comprised of cybersecurity professionals and subject matter experts around the world.
* Platform / Vendor-Specific Guides
  * Network
    * Cisco
  * Operating Systems
    * Microsoft TechNet
  * Web Server
    * Microsoft IIS
    * Apache

**Defense in Depth / Layered Security**

* Defense in Depth - The coordinated use of multiple security countermeasures to information assets.
* Segmentation - The act or practice of splitting a computer network into zones or subnetworks absed on business function or security needs.
  * Uses the following:
    * Physical devices such as routers or switches.
    * Virtual Local Area Networks \(VLANs\)
    * Air Gaps
* Control Diversity - Addressing a security concern using multiple controls that don't depend on one another.
  * Administrative / Process
  * Technical
* Vendor Diversity - Addressing a security concern using multiple vendor products that don't depend on one another.
* User Training - Reduces the impact of threats & vulnerabilities.
