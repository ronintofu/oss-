# Staging

**Secure Staging & Deployment**

* Secure Baseline
  * A process whereby you use a security standard for any system, app, or service that is considered secure to create your own security benchmark.
  * Separately securing the baseline "gold" image to ensure its integrity.
* Environments
  * Separating environments for increased security.
  * Development - App Dev
  * Test - Replicating production as much as possible.
  * Staging - Code preparation/consolidation.
  * Production - Where you do business. Very restricted access.
  * Sandboxing - A completely isolated test environment.
    * A safe execution environment for untrusted programs.
    * Allows programs and processes to be run in an isolated environment to limit access to files and the host system.
    * Example: Web Pages
* Integrity Measurement
  * Monitoring systems against the baseline for any deviations.
    * Examples: Tripwire, Hash Checking
