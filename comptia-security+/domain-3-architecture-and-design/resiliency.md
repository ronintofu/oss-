# Resiliency

**Automation / Scripting**

* Reduces risk through repeatable processes and automated courses of action.
* Leveraging sophisticated monitors and sensors / continuous monitoring.
* Configuration Validation - ensures that new equipment has all the proper settings, applications, and drivers as existing equipment through automation and scripting.
* Operating system scripting languages:
  * Linux Shells: Bash, Ksh
  * Windows: PowerShell

**Master Image**

* AKA 'Gold' Image.
* Creating a model OS verified as 'clean'.
* Used for system restores.
* Needs to be secured.

**Managing Cloud Risk**

* Nonpersistence - Temporary system images. Snapshot of a known, good state.
* Elasticity / Scalability - Adjusting resources as needed.
* High Availability \(HA\) - The measures, such as redundancy, failover, and mirroring, used to keep services and systems operational.
* Redundancy - Replicating systems usually at multiple sites. Associated with failover.
* Distributive Allocation / Load Balancing - Distributing burden across multiple systems.

**Fault Tolerance**

* The ability of a system to sustain operations in the event of a component failure.
* Two key components: spare parts and electrical power.
* Power Protection:
  * Surge Protection
  * Uninterruptible Power Supply \(UPS\)
  * Backup Power / Generators

**RAID Storage**

* Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
* Focuses on availability of data.
* RAID Types
  * 0 - Disk Striping
  * 1 - Disk Mirroring
  * 3 - Disk Striping with a Parity Disk
  * 5 - Disk Striping with Parity
