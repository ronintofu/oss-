### **Embedded Systems**

* One that has software embedded within the computer hardware, usually with a Read One Memory chip \(ROM\).
* A computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.

### **System on a Chip \(SoC\)**

* An integrated circuit that integrates all components of a computer or other electronic systems on a single computer chip.

### **Real-Time Operating Systems \(RTOSs\)**

* An OS intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays.
* Designed to have zero latency.
* Examples in Use: Military & Space applications.

### **Internet of Things \(IoT\)**

* A system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are provided with unique identifiers \(UIDs\) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
* Wearable Technology
  * Watches, Exercise, Medical devices, etc.
  * Often communicates through bluetooth.
* Home Automation
  * Security - Cameras, locks, lights, etc.
  * Thermostats
  * Sound Systems
  * Personal Assistants
* Communicates via Wi-Fi

### **ICS/SCADA**

* ICS - Industrial Control Systems
  * Encompasses several types of control systems and associated instrumentation used for industrial process control.
* SCADA - Supervisor Control and Data Acquisition
  * Used by Utilities and Manufacturing
  * Collects data from factories, plants, or other remote locations and forwards it to a central computer that manages or controls the system.
* PLC - Programmable Logic Controllers
  * Single use computers used in manufacturing.
* Security
  * Access Control
  * Monitoring

### **HVAC**

* Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.
* Many use computer networks or smart tech to regulate airflow and temp.
* Security
  * Network partitioning/segmentation.
  * Access control.
  * Monitoring.

### **Printers / Multi-Function Devices**

* MFD - Multi-Function Devices- used for networked printing, scanning, and copying.
* Web accessible.
* Generally little access control.

### **Special Purpose Devices**

* Medical Devices
* Vehicles
* Aircraft / Unmanned Areal Vehicles \(UAV\)

### **Securing Embedded Devices**

* Secure by design and default.
* Security integrated into the tech.
* System hardening.
* Shielded from electromagnetic interference.
* Network security - encryption via TLS.
* Security verification.
* Automated patching.
* Anomaly alerts.

### **Camera Systems**

* Surveillance Cameras/CCTV
* In most cases, these cameras are connecting back to a central video recorder \(DVR/NVR\).
  * Often can communicate with the DVR/NVR via TCP/IP.
* A lot of cameras are connected via PoE, so you can view what's on the camera if broken into the system.
* IP Connected systems.
