# Physical Security

### **Primary Consideration**

* There is nothing that should impede life safety goals.
* Human life is always top priority.

### **Physical Security Concepts**

* Protection
  * Locks
  * Barriers: Walls, Fences
* Deterrence
  * Guards / Dogs
  * Lighting
* Delay
  * Barricades / Bollards
* Detection
  * Cameras
  * Motion Detection

### **Lighting**

* Used for crime deterrence.
* It is important to have the correct lightning when using various types of surveillance equipment.
* Lighting controls and switches should be in protected, locked, and centralized areas.
* Continuous Lighting - An array of lights that provide an even amount of illumination across an area.
* Controlled Lighting - An organization should erect lights and use illumination in such a way that does not blind its neighbors or any passing cars, trains, or planes.
* Standby Lighting - Lighting that can be configured to turn on and off at different times so that potential intruders think that different areas of the facility are populated.
* Redundant or Backup Lighting - Should be available in case of power failures or emergencies.
* Response Area Illumination - Takes place when an IDS detects suspicious activities and turns on the lights within the specified area.

### **Perimeter Security**

* Fencing, gates, and cages.
* Varying heights, gauge, and mesh provides security features.
* Natural landscaping.
* CPTED - Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design

### **Safes / Locking Cabinets**

* Safes
  * Control Access
  * Fireproof
  * Tamper Resistant and Evident
* Locking Cabinets - Paper & Electronics
* Computer Cable Locks - Reduce Theft
* Key Management
  * Who has keys?
  * Where are they stored?
  * Key Duplication

### **Locks**

* Combination locks - rather than use a key, turn.
* Cipher locks - electronic locks.
* Lock Grades
  * Grade 1 - Commercial
  * Grade 2 - Heavy Duty Residential, Light Commercial
  * Grade 3. - Residential Throw-Away Locks
* Cylinder Categories
  * Low - No pick or drill resistance provided.
  * Medium - A little pick resistance.
  * High - Higher degree of pick resistance.

### **Physical Access Controls**

* Turnstiles
* Mantrap
  * Double doors, where only one can be opened at a time.
  * Use to control personnel access.
  * Manually operated or automatic.
  * Only room for one person.

### **Faraday Cage / Shielding**

* Shielding - The process of preventing electronic emissions from your computer systems from being used to gather intelligence and preventing outside electronic emissions from disrupting information-processing abilities.
* Faraday Cage or Faraday Shield - An enclosure used to block electromagnetic fields. A Faraday shield may be formed by a continuous covering of conductive material or in the case of a Faraday cage, by a mesh of such materials.

### **Barricades / Bollards**

* Bollards are small concrete pillars, sometimes containing lights or flowers.
* They are used to stop people from driving through a wall, often put between a building and a parking lot.
* They can be arranged to form a natural path for walking.

### **Personnel Access Controls**

* There are different technologies to grant access to a building.
  * User Activated - A user does something such as swipe a card or use biometrics.
  * Proximity Devices / Transponders - A system recognizes the presence of an object. 'Electronic Access Control Tokens' are a generic term for proximity authentication systems.

### **Site Access Controls**

* Key Cards
  * Centralized access control consists of card readers, central computer, and electronic door latches.
  * Pros: easy to use, provides an audit record, easy to change access permissions.
  * Cons: can be used by others if lost, people may 'tailgate'.

### **Biometric Access Controls**

* Based upon a specific biometric measurement.
* Fingerprint, Iris Scan, Retina Scan, Hand Scan, Voice, Facial Recognition, etc.
* Greater confidence of claimed identity.

### **Detection**

* Motion Detection - Location monitoring and alarms based on movement.
* Infrared Detection - Detects changes in infrared radiation or thermal heat.

### **Environmental Controls**

* HVAC - Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning
  * Redundancy
  * Backup Power / UPS
  * Zone-Based Heating & Cooling
* Hot and Cold Aisles
  * With a hot aisle, hot air outlets are used to cool the equipment.
  * With cold aisles, cold air intake is used to cool the equipment.
  * Combining the two, you have cold air intake from below the aisle and hot air outtake above it, providing constant circulation.

* Fire Prevention, Detection, & Suppression
  * Prevention - Includes training employees on how to react, supplying the right equipment, enabling fire suppression supply, proper storage of combustible elements.
  * Detection - Includes alarms, manual detection pull boxes, automatic detection response systems with sensors, etc.
  * Suppression - The use of a suppression agent to put out a fire.
    * Two primary examples of fire-suppression systems in use are fire extinguishers and fixed systems.
    * Different types of suppression agents:
      * Water
      * Halon and Halon Substitutes
      * Foams
      * Dry Powders
      * CO2
      * Soda Acid
  * Fire Extinguisher Ratings

* * Sprinkler Systems
    * Wet Pipe - Filled with pressurized water.
    * Dry Pipe - Fills with water only when activated.
    * Deluge - Discharges water from all sprinklers when activated.
    * Pre-Action - Dry pipe that converts to a wet pipe when an alarm is activated.
    * Foam Water Sprinkler - Uses water and fire-retardant foam.
    * Gaseous Fire Suppression - Displaces oxygen.
* Halon Gas - \[[https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get\_pdf.cfm?pub\_id=901395](https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=901395)\]
  * A formerly used, phased out method of fire suppression used for fires with electrical equipment. 
  * _NIST Technical Note 1622_

### **Video Surveillance / Cameras**

* Supplements security guards.
* Work in conjunction with guards or other monitoring mechanisms.
* Provide points of view not easily achieved with guards.
* Locations:
  * Entrances
  * Exits
  * Loading Bays
  * Stairwells
  * Refuse Collection Areas

### **CCTV Considerations**

* Purpose - To detect, assess, and/or identify intruders.
* CCTV Environment: Internal/External
* Field of View: Area to be monitored.
* Illumination: Lighting, natural or artificial.
* Integration with other security controls.

### **Electrostatic IDS** 

_Also known as a 'proximity detector', this IDS uses a magnetic or electrostatic field to detect intrusions._ 

* The Electrostatic IDS creates a balanced electrostatic field between itself and the object being monitored. 
* If an intruder comes within a certain range of the monitored object, it causes capacitance change. 
* The IDS can detect this change and sound an alarm.
