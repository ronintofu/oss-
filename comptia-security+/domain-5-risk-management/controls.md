# Controls

**Controls**

* A defense or countermeasure to put in place to manage risk.
* Policies, strategies, technologies, configuration settings, etc. established in collaboration with various departments of an organization to help mitigate known risks.
* The means of managing risk, including policies, procedures, guidelines, practices, or organizational structures, which can be an administrative, technical, management, or legal nature.

**Control Categories**

* _Technical / Logical Controls_
  * Implemented through technology.
  * May be deterrent, preventive, detective, or compensating.
  * Examples:
    * Patching
    * Firewalls, IDS/IPS
    * Access Controls
* _Administrative / Management Controls_        Purpose: to implement security policies based on procedures, standards, and guidelines.
* Documents, policies, procedures, and guidelines.
  * Acceptable Use Policy
  * Incident Response Plan \(IRP\)
* People/Personnel
  * Security Operations Center
  * Guards
  * Surveillance
* Security Awareness Training
* Physical / Operational Controls
  * Reduce the risk of harm coming to physical property, information, computer systems, or other assets.
  * Examples:
    * Hardened Facility
    * Locks
    * Badges

**Control Types**

* Deterrent Controls
  * Intended to discourage individuals from intentionally violating security policies, procedures, or technologies.
  * Highly visible.
  * Prevent offenses or abuses by influencing choices.
* Preventive Controls
  * Stop an unwanted event.
  * Proactive measures.
  * Examples:
    * Access, authentication, authorization, verification.
    * Separation of Duties
    * Technical Standards
    * Network Security - Firewalls, IPS
    * Internet Filtering
* Detective Controls
  * Warning of anomalies or violations.
  * Automated or Manual
  * Reactive
  * Examples:
    * Cameras
    * Motion Sensors
    * Intrusion Detection System / SIEM
    * Audits
* Corrective Controls
  * Measures to lessen harmful effects or restore the system being impacted.
  * Mostly reactive measures.
  * Examples:
    * Patching/Upgrades
    * Hardening \(Physical / Logical\)
    * Process Improvements
* Compensating Control
  * Alternate controls that are intended to reduce the risk of an existing or potential control weakness.
  * Mechanism that satisfies a required security measure.
  * PCI DSS:
    * Meet the intent and rigor of the original stated requirement.
    * Provide a similar level of defense as the original requirement.
    * Be "above and beyond" other requirements.
    * Be commensurate with the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the requirement.
