# Risk Assessment

**Risk & Threat Definitions**

* NIST - [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary)

**Threat Assessment**

* Threat Agent / Source - the intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation of a vulnerability or a situation and method that may accidentally exploit a vulnerability.
* Threat Vector - the method or path a threat uses to access the target.
* Threat Assessment - a structured process used to identify and evaluate various risks or threats that an organization might be exposed to.

**Threat Assessment Types**

* Environmental - Natural Events
  * Examples: Weather, storms, flooding, earthquakes, fire, etc.
* Manmade - Human Cause
* Internal vs External
  * Origin of the threat source.
  * Is the threat agent inside your organization?
    * Employee, contractor, consultant, etc.

**Risk Assessments**

* Also known as risk analysis or risk calculation.
* Analyzing threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts of a loss of information-processing capabilities \(systems\) or a loss of information itself.
* Process:
  * Identify assets.
  * Identify associated threats & vulnerabilities.
  * Determine likelihood of exploit or compromise.
  * Determine impact of exploit or compromise.
  * Prioritize risk activities / security controls.

**NIST Risk Management Framework**

**Quantitative vs Qualitative Risk Analysis**

* Qualitative
  * Estimating risk values \(likelihood & impact\).
  * Normally using a scale \(1-5\)
  * Subjective and less accurate.

* Quantitative
  * Using real values to calculate risk equation.
  * Numeric.
  * Return on Investment \(ROI\) / Return on Security Investment \(ROSI\)
  * **SLE x ARO = ALE**

**Risk Calculation**

* **SLE x ARO = ALE**
* ALE \(Annual Loss Expectancy\) Value: A monetary measure of how much loss you could expect in a year.
* SLE \(Single Loss Expectancy\) Value: How much you could expect to lose at any one time.
  * SLE can be divided into two components:
    * AV \(Asset Value\): The value of an item.
    * EF \(Exposure Factor\): The percentage of loss.
* ARO \(Annualized Rate of Occurrence\): The likelihood, often drawn from historical data, of an event occurring within a year.

**Risk Calculation Example**

* 'You can reasonably expect that every SLE, which is equal to asset value \(AV\) times exposure factor \(EF\), will be the equivalent of $1000 and that there will be seven such occurrences a year \(ARO\), then the ALE is $7000.
* Conversely, if there is only a 10% chance of an event occurring within a year time period \(ARO = 0.1\) then the ALE drops to $100.

**Risk Response / Strategies**

* Avoidance - making the decision not to engage in the actions associated with that risk.
* Transfer - sharing the burden of the risk with another party \(insurance\).
* Mitigation - taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk.
* Acceptance - choosing to live with a risk. Must be a conscious choice by management.

**Risk Register**

* Recording information about an identified risk.
* Can be specialized software program, cloud service, or master document \(spreadsheet\).
* Contains details about the risks, risk decisions, mitigating controls, risk owner, time frames, residual risk, etc.
* Ensures organization is aligned.

**Supply Chain Assessments**

* AKA Third-Party Assessments
* Review vendor's security posture.
* Any organization connected to yours \(virtual or physical\).
* Often accomplished with checklists.

**Change Management**

* Change \(IT\) - the addition, removal, or altering of information technology environment.
* Change management process goal - to allow for change without disruption, or with only minimal disruption, to these systems and services.
* Need to reassess security risks with any change.
  * The change itself.
  * The after-effects.

**Testing**

* Part of the Risk Analysis process.
* Provides visibility into the risk components.
* Vulnerability assessments.
* Penetration tests.
* Table-top exercises.

**Risk Management Methods**

* _Acceptance_ - Deciding to bear the cost of a potential risk.
* _Avoidance_ - Deciding to no longer employ the actions associated with a particular risk. 
* _Deterrence_ - Discouraging certain actions from being taken to protect against risk.
* _Mitigation_ - Taking steps to reduce risk.
* _Transference_ - Sharing the burden of a potential risk with another entity.
