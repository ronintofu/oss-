# IPv6, WLAN 802.11

**What is IPv6?** [{wiki}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)

* New IP addressing structure.
* 128-bit address represented as 32 hex digits \(IPv4 is 32-bits\).
* Address is composed of 8 groups of 4 hex digits.
  * 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
* Provides 2128 IP addresses = 340 trillion, trillion, trillion \(undecillion\)
* 667 sextillion addresses per square meter of the Earth
* IPv6 is a "separate internet" than the IPv4 internet.

  
**Why IPv6?**

* The internet needs room to grow!
* Pre-1998: IPv4 address exhaustion was predicted \(supporting 4.29 billion addresses\).
* December 1998: IPv6 officiated as RFC 2460 supporting 340 undecillion addresses.
* 2008: IPv6 adoption was expected to complete by 2008 but adoption was very slow.
* 2011: IPv4 address system officially exhausted.
* June 6th, 2012: Major providers turned on IPv6 \(World IPv6 Launch Day\).
* IPv6 adoption now increasing dramatically.

  
What have we been doing since 2011 if IPv4 is still the primary version?  
**Benefits & Improvements**

* Does not use Broadcast messages.
  * Unicast: single source to single destination.
  * Multicast: single source to multiple destinations, scalability improved.
  * Anycast: addressed to a group of nodes, but only sent to the nearest node in the group. Provides for efficient updating of routing tables.
* Simple and efficient addressing structure.
  * Hierarchical and contiguous, provides for better route summarization and smaller, easier to understand routing tables on the global IPv6 internet.
  * Less complicated Network Masks
    * ISPs assign public IPv6 blocks as /48
  * /64 is the standard and default host prefix length.
    * Hosts always have a /64.

* Integrated security and better support for Quality of Service.

  
**Abbreviation Rules**:

1. Drop leading zeros.
   * Example: 2001:**0db8**:85a3:0000:8a2e:**0370**:7334
     * 2001:**db8**:853a:0000:8a2e:**370**:7334

      2. A group of 4 zeroes can be replaced with a single zero.

* * * 2001:db8:853a:**0000**:8a2e:370:7334
    * 2001:db8:85a3:**0**:8a2e:370:7334

       3. Contiguous groups of zeros can be replaced with a double colon, but that can only be done once in an address.

* * * Example: 2001:db8:85a3:**0000**:**0000**:8a2e:370:7334
    * 2001:db8:85a3**::**8a2e:370:7334

  
**IPv6 Loopback0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001**

* Abbreviated: **::1**

  
**IPv6 Address Types**

* Global Address:
  * Unicast address with a predefined globally routable prefix.
  * Used for talking out to the public internet.
  * The range of 2001::/16 is assigned to the global registries
    * Handed out by IANA to the global registries.
* Link-Local Address:
  * Unicast address for the local network link only.
  * Every NIC has one. You will **always** have one.
  * Automatically generated for each IPv6 network interface.
  * Predefined prefix of FE80::/64, not globally routable.

* Unique-Local Address:
  * Unicast address \(prefix FC00::/7\) that is valid within a site or organization or between a limited number of sites.
    * Not usable on the internet.
  * Similar to Private IPv4 addresses.
* How to assign host addresses?
  * Manually configured.
  * Autoconfiguration:
    * Autogenerated random host address.
    * EUI-64 \(Extended Unique Identifier 64\) format based on the MAC address of the host.
      * Take a 48-bit MAC address, split it in half, and insert another 16 bits to make it a 64 bit host address \(then attached to the other 64 bits of Global Prefix \(48\) and Subnet \(16\) for the 128 bit address.
    * DHCPv6 \(Global and Unique-Local only\)
      * Uses DUID \(DHCP Unique-Identifier\) to get an IP address from a DHCPv6 server.
* Ever computer will have a link-local IPv6 address.
* Every computer will have multiple IPv6 addresses.
* The default gateway is the link-local IPv6 address of the gateway router.

**WIRELESS LAN 802.11**

**WLAN/WIFI Basics**  


* Wireless NIC / Wireless Clients
* Wireless Access Point \(WAP\)
  * Standalone AP.
  * SOHO wireless router \(combo device\).

    * Clients can roam between WAPs

  
**LWAPP -** Lightweight Access Point Protocol

![](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s342/res/65f41f74-69d1-abf1-56a9-feec574219e5)

Corporate WLAN environment

* Allows for control of multiple WAPs via a centralized wireless controller server.
* APs pull their config from the centralized Wireless Controller.

  
**CAPWAP** - Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points

* Based on LWAPP.
* Adds additional security.

  
**Frequency Bands & Channels**  
![](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s342/res/1dfe7d07-65ce-ada7-3841-7b33716c7ad1)

* Frequency Bands: 2.4GHz & 5GHz
  * ISM Bands \(Industrial, Scientific, Medical\)
* 2.4GHz
  * B, G, & N.
  * Channels: 1-14
    * North America uses 1-11.
    * Channels overlap, so we only use 3 of them for best practice \(1, 6, and 11\).
      * If we use the others in between, they overlap and the channels get muddied.
