# About

_These are the collected notes of James Somers \[rebrandx\], NexGenT NCSA/P & CompTIA Security+ \(SYO-501\) exam student.   
  
If you want to suggest something be added or changed, please do so_ [{](https://forms.gle/MjnsdXMfvd8hKFKU9)[here}](https://forms.gle/MjnsdXMfvd8hKFKU9).   
  
_I'm adding this simply because I've been asked a few times now: no, I am not charging anyone for anything related to these notes, including the_ [{quizlets}](%20https://quizlet.com/_919uvm?x=1jqt&i=2z4u5u) _that I've made. You can consider them open-source. Because I have been asked, you are welcome to_ [{buy me a coffee}](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/odinn), _but I'll never charge for any material._

## _Sections_

There are three sections herein, Intro to Networking, NexGenT Cyber Security Associate, and CompTIA Security+. You can find those headers in the menu to the left. These are further broken down by modules or domains with notes upon those subjects therein. 

### Note:

These are personal notes meant for studying, so keep that in mind as you'll see spelling and grammatical errors, as well as a general shift in note-taking style over time, as these were taken over a 3 month period. 

Regarding Module 1 of the Intro to Networking section, that was simply introductory and no notes were taken. 

This is an ongoing project and will be updated regularly.
