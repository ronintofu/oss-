# Cyber Ecosystem Overview

**HACKER MINDSET**

**Incentives**

* Financially Motivated \(most cases\)
  * Steal money or steal info that can be sold for money.

**Why Does it Matter?**

* The internet wasn't built with security in mind.
* Lots of interesting loopholes to exploit.
* As the tech matures, so do the attacks.
* 1988: The Morris Worm, first recorded networking attack that brought the entire internet down.
* 2017: WannaCry virus infects hundreds of thousands of computers.
  * A Windows exploit that encrypted user data.
  * Developed by the NSA and leaked to private hackers.
* 2018: BlueBorne Bluetooth attack effects 5.3B devices.
  * Airborne attack that uses Bluetooth to penetrate and take complete control over a device.
  * Doesn't need the device to be paired or connected to the hacker.
  * Every Bluetooth device is susceptible.

**Why Are There Attacks?**

* Easy money.
* Sometimes done just for the fame and recognition.
* To make a statement, because they can.

**Targets**

* Consumers - Banking/Service credentials, confidential info used for identity theft.
  * High Volume
* Businesses - Company financial info, intellectual property, customer databases.
  * Medium Volume
* Nation States - Classified info, infrastructure, dissident groups, political statements.
  * Low Volume
  * Highly Specific/Targeted.

**Risk & Rewards**

* Security is a delicate balance of risk and rewards.
* Both sides want to spend as little as possible to attack/defend their infrastructure.
