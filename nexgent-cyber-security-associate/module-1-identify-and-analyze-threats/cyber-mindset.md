# Cyber Mindset

**Risk Management**

**What is Risk Management?**

* Understanding the threats and vulnerabilities against your assets.
* Important to know your architecture and its weaknesses via threat modeling.

**Critical Attacks**

* 60% of small companies that suffer a cyber attack are out of business within six months.
* Private details leaked \(bank credentials, SSN, CC info - all stuff that leads to ID theft\).
* Critical attacks can bankrupt both individuals and businesses.

**CVE + CWE Frameworks**

* CVE - Common Vulnerability and Exposures
  * Catalog of security vulnerabilities and exposures with each assigned a unique ID.
  * Industry guideline for communications/dialogue regarding specific threats.
* CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration
  * Category system for software weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
  * Helps understand the landscape for mission critical applications.
  * Important contribution to creating more secure and robust software applications.

**Security Awareness**

**Threat Landscape**

* The threat landscape is evolving fast and constantly introducing new risks.

**CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**

**Types of Threats**  

* Ransomware
  * Type of attack designed to restrict access to files/systems until ransom is paid.
  * Paying ransom does not guarantee that anything will be recovered.
  * Ransomware attacks have more than doubled this year.
* Malware
  * Type of software designed to cause harm to your computer/data.
  * Malware can perform a variety of different functions such as stealing, altering/deleting data. Come in forms of a virus, worm, trojan, etc.
* Phishing
  * Type of attack meant to steal sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy source.
  * Most common method of attack and highly successful.
* Social Engineering
  * Type of attack meant to manipulate people into giving up confidential information.
  * In organizations, people tend to be the weakest link.

**Product Design & Security**

* Good security is tough.
* Nothing is ever 100% secure.
* Usability and security are counter-intuitive to each other.
* Security is expensive and slows down the page of product development.
* Requires constant vigilance.
* Rate of Return is not linear to spending \(chain link security\).
