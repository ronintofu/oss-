# Module 8 - Incident Response

**INCIDENT RESPONSE:** [**https://learn.nexgent.com/modules/cyber-security-specialist-module8/sections/cyber-security-specialist-module8-section2/lessons/cyber-security-specialist-module8-incidentresponse**](https://learn.nexgent.com/modules/cyber-security-specialist-module8/sections/cyber-security-specialist-module8-section2/lessons/cyber-security-specialist-module8-incidentresponse)

**What is Incident Response?**

* An organized approach to addressing & managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack.
* The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and recovery time costs.

* Incidents that are not properly contained and handled can escalate into a bigger problem that can ultimately lead to a damaging data breach or system collapse.
  * Responding to an incident quickly will help an organization:
    * Minimize losses.
    * Mitigate exploited vulnerabilities.
    * Restore services.
    * Reduce the risks.
* Incident response enables an organization to be prepared for the unknown as well as the known.
  * Incident response also allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage.
* Incident response is a crucial component of running a business as most organizations rely on sensitive information that would be detrimental if compromised.
* Security incidents can be expensive as businesses could face regulatory fines, legal fees, and data recovery costs.
  * It could affect future profits as untreated incidents are correlated with lower brand reputation, customer loyalty, and customer satisfaction.
* While organizations cannot eradicate incidents completely, incident response processes help minimize them.
  * Emphasis should be placed on what can be done in advance to brace for the impact of a security incident.
* While hackers will always continue to exist, a team can be prepared to prevent and respond to their attacks.
* The following are examples of common incidents that can have a negative impact on businesses:
  * DDoS attack against critical cloud services.
  * A malware or ransomware infection that has encrypted critical business files across the corporate network.
  * A successful phishing attempt that has lead to the exposure of PII of customers.
  * An unencrypted laptop known to have sensitive customer records that has gone missing.
* Security incidents that would typically warrant the execution of a formal incident response procedures are considered both urgent and important.
* Another important aspect of understanding incident response is defining the difference between threats and vulnerabilities.
  * A threat is an indication or stimulus, such as a criminal hacker or dishonest employee that is looking to exploit a vulnerability for a malicious or financial gain.
  * A vulnerability is a weakness in a computer system, business process, or user that can be easily exploited.
* Threats exploit vulnerabilities which, in turn, create business risk.
* The potential consequences included unauthorized access to sensitive information, assets, identity theft, systems taken offline, and legal/compliance violations.

  
**Incident Response Framework**There are six key phases of an incident response plan:

1. **Preparation**: preparing users and IT staff to handle potential incidents should they arise.
2. **Identification**: determining whether an event qualifies as a security incident.
3. **Containment**: limiting the damage of the incident and isolating affected systems to prevent further damage.
4. **Eradication**: finding the root cause of the incident and removing affected systems from the production environment.
5. **Recovery**: permitting affected systems back into the production environment and ensuring no threat remains.
6. **Lessons** **Learned**: completing incident documentation, performing analysis to learn from the incident and potentially improving future response efforts.

  
Common best practices to include:

* An overview of the plan.
* A list of roles and responsibilities.
* A list of incidents requiring action.
* The current state of the network infrastructure and security safeguards.
* Detection, investigation, and containment procedures.
* Steps toward eradication.
* Steps toward recovery.
* The breach notification process.
* A list of follow-up tasks.
* A call list.
* Incident response plan testing.
* Any revisions. 

  
**Plan Management**

* Incident response requires thoughtful planning, ongoing oversight, and clear metrics so that efforts can be properly measured.
* Specific metrics used to measure the effectiveness of incident response initiatives might include:
  * Number of incidents detected.
  * Number of incidents missed.
  * Number of incidents requiring action.
  * Number of repeat incidents.
  * The remediation timeframe.
  * Number of incidents that led to breaches.
* What does an incident response team do?
  * A good incident response program requires putting together a cross-functional team from diverse parts of the business.
  * Without th eright people in place, any attempted incident response efforts will likely be ineffective.
  * The team not only helps to execute the incident response plan but also aids with ongoing oversight and maintenance including the day-to-day administration of technical controls.
* Each team member should have clearly defined duties and goals.
* These are actions that not only take place during an incident but also before an incident occurs and afterwards as well.
* The incident response team may involve members of the organizations overall security committee.

  
**Best Practices**

* With the goals of keeping the business running and minimizing the impact of unforeseen events, incident response could be considered part of the business continuity process.
  * An incident response plan is dedicated to incidents and breaches impacting networks, computers, applications, and databases, as well as related information assets.
  * Therefore, most organizations are best served by keeping the incident response plan in a standalone document, separate from yet referenced in the business continuity plan.
* The most important thing is to ensure the incident response plan is easily accessible by all team members when it is needed.
* While incident response is a process, technology can be used to automate and streamline specific incident response functions to help minimize detection times and system errors.

**CYBER FORENSICS**: [https://learn.nexgent.com/modules/cyber-security-specialist-module8/sections/cyber-security-specialist-module8-section2/lessons/cyber-security-specialist-module8-cyberforensics](https://learn.nexgent.com/modules/cyber-security-specialist-module8/sections/cyber-security-specialist-module8-section2/lessons/cyber-security-specialist-module8-cyberforensics)

**What is Cyber Forensics?**

* Cyber forensics is the investigation & analysis techniques to gather/preserve evidence from a computing device.
* The goal is to perform a structure investigation while maintaining a documented chain of evidence to find out what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it.

**Why is it important?**

* Cyber crime is growing, need a way to hold those involved accountable.
* Cyber forensics can be used to prevent and detect crim as well as provide digital evidence to settle disputes.
* Commercial organizations can benefit from cyber forensics in cases such as:
  * Forgeries, industrial espionage, employment disputes, fraud, investigations, intellectual property theft, and bankruptcy investigations.

**Techniques**

* Multiple techniques used in different ways:
  * Cross Drive Analysis - correlates data found from multiple drives.
  * Live Analysis - cloning the images of the drives so they don't know an analysis is taking place, preserves all normal functionality.
    * RAM Analysis
  * Deleted Files - recovery of deleted files, also known as file carving.

**Best Practices**

* Write protect the original, copy it, and examine only the copy.
* Examination results should be reviewed by a supervisor and peer reviewed on a regular schedule.
* All hardware and software should be tested to insure they produce accurate and reliable results.
* Forensic examiners must obnserve the highest ethical standards.
* Forensic examiners must remain objective at all times.
* Forensic examiners must strictly observe all legal restrictions on their examinations.

**CONTINGENCY PLANNING & BACKUPS**: [https://learn.nexgent.com/modules/cyber-security-specialist-module8/sections/cyber-security-specialist-module8-section2/lessons/cyber-security-specialist-module8-contingency](https://learn.nexgent.com/modules/cyber-security-specialist-module8/sections/cyber-security-specialist-module8-section2/lessons/cyber-security-specialist-module8-contingency)

**What is Contingency Planning?**

* It is the implementation of a comprehensive strategy to maintain business operations during a catastrophic event like a data breach or ransomware invasion.
* By creating contingency plans, an organization mtiigates its risk and minimizes the loss of critical assets if an attack were to happen.

**Why is it important?**

* Business continuity planning is the implementation of a comprehensive strategy to maintain business operations during a catastrophic event like a data breach or ransomware invasion.
* By creating contingency plans, an organization mitigates its risk and minimizes the loss of critical assets if an attack were to happen.

**Backup Considerations**

* While a contingency plan defines how the organization will operate during an attack, the organization must also take steps to minimize potential loss of data and other information after an attack.
  * The organization must have an effective backup plan in place to rapidly restore service following a cyberattack.
* An organization's backup strategy will depend on its operational priorities, as well as on its size and specific operational environment.
* Are systems fuklly redundant and load-balanced?
* Is data mirrored so that if something happens, the system can be restored?
* Are files spread across all available storage and not located in a single storage location?
* Does the organization have Service Level Aggreements \(SLAs\) with commercial entities?
* Is data backed up on different devices?
* Does teh department use automatic failover and server clustering?
* Is the organization prepared for a loss of power during an attack?

**Best Practices**

* Select, purchase, and install all hardware, software, and licenses for the system.
* Verify the installation of antivirus software on all computers and turn on automatic updates.
* Configure all computers to use junk e-mail filtering and install spam filtering on the mail server.
* Turn on automatic software updates for all computers.
* Locate the server in a locked room with controlled access.
